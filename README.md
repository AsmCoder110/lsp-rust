[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/lsp-rust-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/lsp-rust)

Rust support for lsp-mode using the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls).

Warning: rls is currently very unstable, which can make Emacs hang indefinitely. Using
this in production isn't recommended.
